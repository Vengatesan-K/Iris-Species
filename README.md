# Iris-Species
Classify iris plants into three species in this classic dataset

> Iris Dataset, and it contains features of different flower species. Independent features in this dataset are Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. All these lengths were in centimeters. And Dependent feature, which will be the output for the model, is Species. It contains the name of the species to which that particular flower with those measurements belongs.

> In fact, three of these iris species look similar, but the difference in measurements can be used to classify them. This data set is a classic example of supervised learning. The input variables are sepal length and width and petal length and width; each row represents an instance or observation. The output variable is Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, or Iris-virginica; each column represents a class label.
